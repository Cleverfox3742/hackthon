            SOLAR SYSTEM
    <br> Solar System is a collection of planets, moons, asteroids and comets and other rocky objects orbiting the Sun.</br> 
    <br>The universe is everything. It includes all of space, and all the matter and energy that space contains. It even includes time itself and, of course, it includes you. 
    <br>Earth and the Moon are part of the universe, as are the other planets and their many dozens of moons. </br>

        <h3>The Big Bang </h3>
        <p>The Big Bang event is a physical theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature. Various cosmological models of the Big Bang explain the evolution of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form.</p>
        <p><br>As space expanded, the universe cooled and matter formed. One second after the Big Bang, the universe was filled with neutrons, protons, electrons, anti-electrons, photons and neutrinos</br></p>
